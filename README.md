Minor Project: Bike Stage Design
Project Overview
This project is part of the curriculum for my internship at ThermalR Industries. 
The objective was to design a bike stage using Solid Edge, perform Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to optimize material and cost,
and select a suitable motor based on the rotating weight and required RPM.

Tools Used
CAD Software: Solid Edge
Analysis: Finite Element Analysis (FEA)

Project Details

1. Stage Design
Objective: Design a stage capable of supporting a bike, considering its weight and wheelbase.
Steps:
Measured the weight and wheelbase of the bike.
Designed the stage in Solid Edge, ensuring it can accommodate the bike's dimensions and weight.

3. Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
Objective: Perform FEA to minimize material usage and reduce overall cost while maintaining structural integrity.
Steps:
Imported the stage design into the FEA module.
Applied loads and constraints based on the bike's weight and expected usage.
Analyzed the stress distribution and identified areas where material could be reduced without compromising strength.
Iteratively refined the design to achieve an optimal balance between material usage and structural performance.

5. Motor Selection
Objective: Select a suitable motor to rotate the stage considering the rotating weight and desired RPM.
Steps:
Calculated the total rotating weight of the bike and stage.
Determined the required RPM for the stage rotation.
Researched and compared various motors based on power output, torque, and efficiency.
Selected the motor that best met the requirements while being cost-effective.
Conclusion
The project successfully achieved the following:

Designed a bike stage that can support the specified bike.
Optimized the design through FEA to reduce material and cost.
Selected an appropriate motor to ensure efficient and effective stage rotation.
